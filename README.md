# Dinner Time!
This is a simulation for teaching object oriented programming, particularly, as it relates to user interfaces and animation. 

It will be demo'd and re-built by students in a spring/summer 2020 workshop (details TBD). 

The user grabs a mystery can of cat food out of a bag. Cats are programmed with their favorite foods, and respond if the current can is one of their favorites. The accessibility information for the simulation updates as events occur.
