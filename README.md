# Dinner Time!
This is a demo for teaching object oriented programming, particularly, as it relates to design and animation. 

The user grabs a mystery can of cat food out of a bag. Cats are programmed with their favorite foods, and respond if the current can is one of their favorites. 

As I develop this app, I’m simultaneously looking for an organization/meetup to host a workshop on this topic. If you have a teaching opportunity, I’d love to chat!
