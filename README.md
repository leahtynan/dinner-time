# Dinner Time!
This is a demo for teaching object oriented programming concepts, particularly, OOP as it relates to design and animation. 

The concept is: clicking a graphic (or pressing a button...exact UI interaction TBD) grabs a mystery can of cat food from a bag. Cats are programmed with their favorite foods, have fur colored according to their object data, and respond (meow and animation) if the current can is one of their favorites. I haven't decided whether this interaction is the right scope, or if I should expand it into a game.

As I develop this app, I’m simultaneously looking for an organization/meetup to host a workshop on this topic. If you have a teaching opportunity, I’d love to chat!
